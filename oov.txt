Token-based OOV %: This metric measures the proportion of individual word tokens encountered in the target dataset that are not present in the Reference Vocabulary. This metric reflects the frequency with which unknown words are encountered when processing the target dataset's text stream. A higher percentage suggests more frequent encounters with unknown terms, potentially indicating drift in common word usage or the need for robust unknown token handling in downstream models.

Unique Word-based OOV %: This metric measures the proportion of the target dataset's distinct vocabulary that consists of words not seen in the Reference Vocabulary. It highlights the extent of vocabulary expansion or shift in the target dataset. A higher percentage indicates that the target data introduces a larger proportion of genuinely new terms (e.g., new concepts, jargon, entities, product names), regardless of how frequently each new term is used.

Both metrics provide complementary insights. The Token-Based OOV focuses on the frequency of unknown word encounters during processing, while the Unique Word-Based OOV focuses on the breadth of new vocabulary introduced in a dataset compared to the reference. All comparisons are performed case-insensitively by converting text to lowercase.
